# 👋 Meet Arfan

Hey there! I'm **Md Arfan Uddin**, and I'm excited you've found your way here.

I'm currently a **Ph.D. student in Software Engineering** at the University of Arizona. My research lies at the intersection of **AI and microservices**, focusing on using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to improve **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** in distributed systems. Imagine systems that can automatically analyze logs and traces to tell you what went wrong and how to fix it—this is the future I'm building toward.

But my journey didn't start in research labs.

### From Code to Cloud to Research

With over **4 years of professional experience** as a full-stack and mobile developer, I've worked across multiple domains—from research platforms to real-time apps. I led engineering for **KMap**, a campus-wide research visualization tool, and co-created **ScholarPaw**, a scholarship management platform. I've always been passionate about building systems that don't just work—but scale, evolve, and empower.

Along the way, I've adopted tools like **Next.js**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **Redis**, and **Supabase**, and embraced principles of DevSecOps, microservice architecture, and automation. These experiences have deeply shaped how I approach both system design and research.

### Building Connecto: From Frustration to Founding

In 2024, I founded [**Connecto**](https://getconnecto.app)—a real-time networking app built to solve a common but overlooked problem: people attending the same event often miss opportunities to meet others around them.

Connecto helps users **find and connect with people nearby at events, meetups, or even coffee shops**—all in real time. Whether you're looking to expand your network, meet fellow attendees, or simply find someone with shared interests, Connecto makes that happen effortlessly. It's a startup born out of personal frustration, refined by user feedback, and built for human connection in physical spaces.

### Why This Blog Exists

This blog is a journal of my journey—part research log, part builder's notebook, and part personal reflection. You'll find posts on:

- 🚀 AI and LLM applications in software engineering
- 🧠 Research insights on debugging microservices
- 🛠 Building scalable systems and side projects
- 💼 Lessons from transitioning into tech entrepreneurship
- 🧑‍🏫 Life as a PhD + MBA student juggling research, coding, and startups

### Let's Connect

If you're a fellow researcher, engineer, builder, or just someone curious—I'd love to connect. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfn/), check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/arfan-rfn), or explore [Connecto](https://getconnecto.app).

Thanks for stopping by. Here's to learning, building, and making meaningful things together. 💫
